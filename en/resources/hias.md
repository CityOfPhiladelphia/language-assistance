Working to rescue, relocate and resettle Jews and peoples of all religion and nationalities who are fleeing persecution and discrimination.
Since 1882, the primary mission of HIAS & Council Migration Service of Philadelphia has been to rescue, relocate and resettle Jews and peoples of all religion and nationalities who are fleeing persecution and discrimination. HIAS and Council provides law-related immigration services to the foreign born and their families who seek asylum, family reunification, permanent legal status and citizenship in the U.S. HIAS and Council offers refugee counseling and processing assistance, acculturation, education and advocacy to, and on behalf of, prospective refugees, immigrants, their families, and friends in the Delaware Valley and the Tri-State region.

HIAS and Council strive to advance the fair treatment and protection of the rights of immigrants and refugees, and to educate to larger community about the positive economic, social and cultural contributions made by new Americans. The agency provides assistance to refugees and immigrants so that they can become productive members of society. HIAS and Council serves individuals of limited means, and does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin or handicap.

HIAS also coordinates a state-wide Asylee Outreach Project that links those granted asylum to refugee social services. The project assists with documentation issues facing asylees. As a non-profit agency authorized by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to provide legal immigration assistance, HIAS and Council Migration Service is required to keep service fees at nominal levels. Clients providing evidence of inability to pay even the lowest fees qualify for free service.
