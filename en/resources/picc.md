Convening professionals, advocates and immigrant groups of different backgrounds to share information and resources, identify common problems, and advocate for solutions.
The Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition (PICC) is a diverse group that brings together professionals, advocates and immigrant groups of different backgrounds to share information and resources, identify common problems, and advocate for solutions. They have 50 member organizations and numerous individual members. Their membership includes community groups, legal service providers, social service providers, mutual assistance associations, immigrant leaders, unions, faith communities, and concerned individuals. Refugees and other new Americans make significant contributions to our nation, state, region, and our local communities. They pay taxes in our local economy, revitalize neighborhoods as renters, consumers and even business owners and home owners, and bring a rich cultural diversity.
PICC is a diverse coalition that represents the needs of immigrants, migrants, refugees and other new Americans living in Pennsylvania to policy makers, public officials, and the general public. PICC seeks to educate the public and develop support for fair policies that welcome and sustain immigrants.
