Providing low-income Philadelphia residents with advice and representation in civil legal matters, advocating for their legal rights, and conducting community education.
The mission of Community Legal Services (CLS) of Philadelphia is to help low-income Philadelphia residents obtain equal access to justice by providing them with advice and representation in civil legal matters, advocating for their legal rights, and conducting community education about the legal issues that affect them.

For more than 40 years, Community Legal Services of Philadelphia has provided the highest quality legal assistance to low-income Philadelphians who cannot afford legal counsel when they most need it. We provide free legal assistance on a wide variety of matters, including housing, health care, employment, public benefits, consumer scams, home ownership, loans and collections, property taxes, SSI disability benefits, DHS (parents only), nursing home and personal care homes, credit card debt, and utilities.
CLS' Language Access Project coordinates CLS services to Philadelphia's growing limited English proficient and immigrant communities. CLS provides direct legal representation to limited English proficient clients or client groups who have been denied equal access to services or benefits on account of language. CLS partners with many organizations to advocate for language access for limited English proficient clients to services and benefits at the local, state and national levels.
