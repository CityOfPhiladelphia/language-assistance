=================

Telephonic Interpretation
-------------------------
Telephonic interpretation is an over-the-phone interpretation service available to limited English proficient (LEP) constituents that call in to City agencies, or visit walk-in counter services seeking assistance. When an LEP constituent calls or visits a City agency, staff are able to provide assistance to them, in their language, by contacting an off-site interpreter over the phone. Telephonic interpretation is widely used by City agencies. It is available to LEP constituents at no cost to them. LEP individuals should look for an “Interpretation Services Available” sign to indicate their need for telephonic interpretation.

Document Translation
--------------------
Document translation is used by City agencies that regularly communicate information with residents in paper format. When distributing information, agencies will often have it translated into several languages to benefit limited English proficient (LEP) constituents. As new languages are encountered, appropriate documentation is translated to meet the need. LEP individuals have the right to request that documents are translated on an as need basis.

In-Person Interpretation
------------------------
In-person interpretation is an on-site interpretation service provided to limited English proficient (LEP) constituents. This service is typically requested for predetermined meetings between LEP constituent(s) and City staff members. When City staff are aware of a meeting with an LEP constituent, they are able to request an on-site interpreter to attend and interpret the communication between them. Should an LEP constituent require interpretation services, for a future meeting, they have the right to request one, at no cost to them.

Training of City Employees 
--------------------------
Training is an essential aspect of language access services for many City agencies. In circumstances where services are provided in face-to-face settings, bilingual staff often interact with limited English proficient (LEP) constituents. To better serve LEP individuals in these instances, several agencies have bilingual staff trained as certified interpreters. Some trainings that have been provided to bilingual City staff have included: Certified Interpreter Training, How To Work With An Interpreter, and basic language classes. Agencies that have utilized training include the Police Department, Department of Public Health, and Department of Human Services. This service is requested by City agencies on an as need basis.
