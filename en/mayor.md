Message from Mayor Michael A. Nutter
====================================
Dear Friend,

Welcome to Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love.  From its inception, Philadelphia has been a welcoming place to people from many walks of life.  Our country was built by immigrants and our strength as a City continues to be reinforced by our vibrant diversity.  

In recent years, Philadelphia has begun to re-emerge as a regional center of cultural diversity, with an increasing population attributable in part to newcomers from around the world.  According to the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institute, “Among its peer regions, Metropolitan Philadelphia has the largest and fastest growing immigrant population, which now stands at over 500,000, comprising 9% of the total population.”  

As we grow as a City, it is important that all residents are able to access City services without barriers.  Global Philadelphia serves as a unifier to strengthen the relationship between our diverse linguistic communities and the City by improving Philadelphia’s language accessibility.  Every member of this City has a voice that deserves to be heard and Global Philadelphia ensures that residents who are limited English proficient have that voice.   

As Mayor, I am committed to making sure all residents are heard and understood, regardless of language proficiency.  The City will continue to improve the integration and inclusion of newcomers, language and cultural minorities into the social and economic fabric of the City.  I look forward to continuing our efforts to make the City of Philadelphia a great international destination point.

Sincerely,  
Michael A. Nutter  
Mayor of Philadelphia
